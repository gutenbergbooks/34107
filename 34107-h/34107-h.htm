<h1 style="font-size: large; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">NOTE ABOUT &ldquo;CURRIES&rdquo; IN<br/>
&ldquo;SATURDAY REVIEW,&rdquo; OCTOBER 22, 1887.</h1>

<hr/>

<p class="no-indent" style="font-size: smaller; line-height: 1.3em;"><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> who likes Curry, and who can get it (the pamphlet, not the
Curry), should invest in a little pamphlet by &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Daniel Santiagoe</span>,
son of Francis Daniel, butler and fiddler, of Colombo, Ceylon, and the
Ceylon Court, Royal Jubilee Exhibition, Liverpool.&rdquo; It is written in
delightful pigeon-English (or whatever other bird may be more appropriate
to Ceylon's isle), is quite unpretentious, avows the author's very
legitimate, and, indeed, laudable desire to &ldquo;make a small fortune&rdquo; by
its sale, and contains admirable receipts. Mr. Santiagoe is much less
cynical than the apocryphal Mrs. Glasse. He says, after recommending
the more excellent way of the Curry Stone, &ldquo;The best and easy
way is to buy from your respected grocers, which, I should say, ought
to be of two colours&mdash;one is brown and the other is yellow, and the red
is cayenne pepper (if required, hot <ins title="curries).">curries).&rdquo;</ins> He is a little plaintive
about mulligatawny. &ldquo;Why English people always spell this word
wrong? Everybody knows this&mdash;mollagoo, &lsquo;pepper;&rsquo; tanney, &lsquo;water.&rsquo;&rdquo;
So the reformers who call it &ldquo;mulligatunny&rdquo; are just as bad as we
devotees of mumpsimus and mulligatawny ourselves. We note with
special pleasure a receipt for &ldquo;chicken moley&rdquo;&mdash;evidently the same
genus as that &ldquo;mollet&rdquo; which puzzled Mrs. Clarke. And all the prescriptions
are interesting. &ldquo;Maldive fish&rdquo; seems to take the place of
&ldquo;Bombay duck&rdquo; in these southern regions, and the number of Vegetable
Curries is particularly noteworthy. Nobody need think from the
specimens we have given that Mr. Santiagoe is unintelligible. His
English may be &ldquo;pigeon,&rdquo; but it is a much more easily digestible
tongue than the high and mighty gobble-gobble of some of our own
professors of style and matter.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">INTRODUCTION BY J. L. SHAND, Esq.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Daniel Santiagoe</span>, who has twice come from his
Ceylon home to serve me in England and Scotland,
now gives to the world a second edition of a
very valuable little book, and has asked me to
write him an introduction.</p>

<p>An introduction is generally apologetic, but I
depart from custom and congratulate the purchasers
of this book upon obtaining a collection
of recipes which may add much to their gastronomic
enjoyment, and perhaps also contribute to health
and longevity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care for Curry, it is too hot!!!&rdquo; is a
common but erroneous plaint; and the disciple of
Santiagoe will find recipes which provide the full
delicacy of Eastern condiments without the discomfort
of excessive heat.</p>

<p>Why do old East Indians live so long? is a
question often asked.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_x" title="x"> </a>
Because so many of them are pensioners, says
the student of finance.</p>

<p>Because so many of them are Curry eaters, says
the student of hygiene.</p>

<p>All human nature requires to be occasionally
stimulated, and a mild Curry acts upon the torpid
liver, reacts upon the digestive organs, and provides
the necessary stimulant without injurious
consequences.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that nearly all Curry-eating
nations are abstainers from strong drinks.</p>

<p>Daniel Santiagoe's English may occasionally provoke
a smile, but it is &ldquo;English as she is spoken&rdquo;
by several millions of Her Majesty's subjects, and
its originality often lends it force.</p>

<p>Were excuse necessary it would be found in this,
that Daniel Santiagoe is a domestic servant to
whom English is a foreign tongue.</p>

<h2>PREFACE BY AUTHOR.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">With</span> much thankfulness to Mr. A. Egmont Hake
for his kindness in writing a preface for my first
book on Curries, and great credit is due to <cite>Saturday
Review</cite> and humble respect is due to my two
masters, Shand, Haldane &amp; Co., of London, who
brought me over to England and Scotland, with four
other servants, and allowed me to publish a little
book to make my desired little fortune, which is
highly creditable. From the first edition of 500
copies I fully sold 400, and another hundred
copies presented to friends in England and Ceylon.
My intention in publishing this second edition
is that I have given too little recipes and
information in my first book for sixpence each
copy. Though I thought it is worth making it an
enlarged and revised edition for same price this
time, I should like to give good many recipes for
making a Curry, and give the names of all Meat
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xii" title="xii"> </a>and Vegetable in English and Tamil. In each
heading of Curries two sorts of ingredients are
given&mdash;one to be procured in England, the other
in Ceylon; and also each Curry will be properly
instructed. I have tasted the Curries made by
Bengalee, etc., on board of steamers and on shore.
They use proper Curry Stuffs, etc., but they
flavour it too much; using plenty of ghee and fat
mutton, etc.,&mdash;these spoil the taste. Just the
same with Bombay Curries, but in Madras is the
only place you could taste a proper Curry, and
also in Ceylon, as a good many cooks of Madras
Presidency came to Ceylon several years ago and
spread out the art of general cooking in Ceylon.
I believe at first the cooking business was instructed
by European cooks. At present there is
too many cooks in Ceylon; almost every butler,
appoo, second servant, kitchen mate, groom, etc.,
knows to cook a English dinner!!!</p>

<p>Now we shall go on with our Curry business.
I recommend to try Curry Powders from several
grocers. The best Curry Powder is made of
coriander seed (which could be got from the
chemist's), saffron, dry chillies, cumin seed, few
mustard seed, few pepper corns. If the Curry
Powder contains all the above, it is a good Curry
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xiii" title="xiii"> </a>Powder. Some Curry Powders tastes of acid,
flour, and other mixtures, which I believe is unwholesome
in every means. The Tamils use
tamarind for the acid taste. To every brown
Curries the Singalese use Gorakka<a name="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (a sour fruit),
slightly dried, and lime juice to their yellow
Curries. There is much different taste between
a Singalese Curry and a Tamil Curry&mdash;the taste
just differs the same as a Madras beef Curry,
No.&nbsp;4, and a potato Curry (vegetable). The
Curries should be treated same as a ordinary
entree. If one article you had too much, it will
spoil the whole Curry. If the meat over done,
no taste in it. If you have all Curry stuffs, etc.,
at hand, could make a Curry Sauce in ten
minutes the longest, and can warm up any meat
for table in it (I mean the brown). The white
Curry Sauce is not suitable, unless for a vegetable
or fish.</p>

<p>I could give several other recipes to Curries, but
the above said sixty will be quite sufficient. If
you carefully tried the above said Curries will be
found most economical.</p>

<p>A Madras woman can beat any other Indian
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xiv" title="xiv"> </a>woman in Curry cooking. In several gentry's
houses in Madras, etc., they keep a woman to
make Curries and prepare vegetables for table&mdash;we
call her &ldquo;Thanney Kareyitchi&rdquo;&mdash;besides the
cook and kitchen matey.</p>

<p>The Madras Curry always the best, much different
than a Bengal or Bombay Curry, to my
opinion.</p>

<h2>PREFACE OF MY FIRST EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center" style="font-size: larger; margin-top: -0.7em;"><span class="smcap">By A. Egmont Hake</span>, Esq.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">[<i>TRUE COPY.</i>]</p>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> author of this little work has asked me to write
him a Preface, and I gladly do so, especially if it
will help to find him buyers, as well as readers,
who will put into practice the admirable receipts
he offers to gourmets and others. For my own
part I can speak with some authority&mdash;indeed the
best&mdash;as to the excellence of Santiagoe's Curries,
for I am among the fortunate few who have tasted
them in England.</p>

<p>I was particularly struck by a remark which
Santiagoe made when I asked him what he would
like me to write in his little book. Some authors
might have replied &ldquo;Speak up for my Curries!&rdquo;
others might have said, &ldquo;Say a good word for my
book;&rdquo; but he, in the fulness of gratitude, said,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xvi" title="xvi"> </a>&ldquo;Praise my Masters.&rdquo; He then went on to speak
of how Mr. Shand and Mr. Haldane had brought
him and his fellow-servants all the way from Ceylon
to England.</p>

<p>It is only fair to point out that the English of
this little book is not &ldquo;English as she is spoken,&rdquo;
but represents the expression of Santiagoe in its
native costume&mdash;it is Tamil Anglicised by Santiagoe
himself. As Santiagoe says, &ldquo;I like broken
English, because ladies gentlemen like that.&rdquo; The
author is a native of Trichinopoly. His grandfather
and uncle were distinguished drummers in
Indian infantry regiments&mdash;in other words, they
were masters of the tom-tom. He has lived all his
life in Ceylon,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and for the last seven years&mdash;that
is, since he was sixteen&mdash;has been in the service
of English residents, of whom he appears to have
nothing but pleasant recollections. It would seem
that this will be the case in his experience of England,
whither he has come with others as waiter at
the Ceylon Tea Rooms in the Liverpool Exhibition&mdash;though
he told me with much modesty that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xvii" title="xvii"> </a>&ldquo;people were very kind, but he supposed the
Ceylon servants were a novelty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is, to say the least, highly creditable to Santiagoe
that, with many duties to perform, and these
amid the distracting influences of our Western civilization,
he should have compiled this useful little guide
to the art of Curry cooking. The spirit of Brillat-Savarin
and of Soyer is stronger than the ephemeral
attractions of an exhibition. Let us hope Santiagoe's
enterprise will be more lasting than these;
that it will achieve its aim in popularizing Ceylon
Curries in this country; and that his &ldquo;Book on
Curries&rdquo; will pass through many editions, and
bring him the &ldquo;little fortune&rdquo; he deserves.</p>

<h2>COPY OF THE NOTE OF MY FIRST
EDITION ON CURRIES.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I beg</span> to bring the following Receipts to Curries,
etc. I hope it will be handy to ladies, housekeepers,
cooks, etc. I only mention the easy way
of making it in England, for scarcity of fresh and
pure Curry stuffs none procurable. Still, it is very
troublesome to grind the Curry stuffs without a
Curry stone, which is very common to a native
Cooly of India. No native houses without a Curry
stone. The way the native girls, etc., grind the
Curry stuffs will be an astonishment to European
ladies. The best way to grind the Curry powder in
England, by hard stone made mortar or pounder,
but the best and easy way is to buy from your
respected grocers, which, I should say, ought to be
of two colours, one is brown and the other is
yellow, and the red is cayenne pepper (if required
hot Curries).</p>

<p>With regard to above, if care should be taken
and make the Curries with any of the following
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xix" title="xix"> </a>meat:&mdash;Beef, mutton, chicken, fish, etc., etc., and
vegetables, you will find it an economical dish for
an English meal to have an Indian dish; if little
care and attention is given to it, will find it as a
relish. The same time I must say, many parties
visited our Indian continent will know the taste of
a Curry as well as my own experience. I have
been instructed by several head cooks of India and
Ceylon. My own people are cooks under several
respected gentry of Ceylon and India. Now, I
must say, it is a national food to natives of India
and Ceylon as beef and bread to Europeans. With
attention to this I myself am a servant of gentlemen
as approved cook, second boy, dressing boy, house
and general servant, and will answer to several
other capacity, as clerk, store-keeper, etc., etc. I
only thought of publishing this little work by request
of several parties requiring me to write some
good Curries.</p>

<p>So just the same time I may have the chance of
printing it and make a small fortune by the favour
of customers, and by their favouring me to sell
these few hundred copies, will be highly thankful;
but I regret to say that I should have written large
and more recipes, but my time is very little to spare
to attend to this work.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xx" title="xx"> </a>
With regards I hope the lovers of Curry will be
satisfy with these accompanying recipes, which, I
should say can be made in England with Curry
stuffs and provisions procurable here. The fact is
I myself have tried several of these Curries in England
during my short visit in England, and found
to be a good result, in fact, not in its original taste,
but only second to it in my opinion. If carefully
prepared will find it as a economical dish for breakfast,
lunch, or dinner. Only little time and attention
is required. I wish the reader will have the
pleasure of reading this book right through first.</p>

<p>Another matter to point out, that in Madras
cooks make Curries with or without cocoanut, but
in Ceylon no Curries without cocoanut, neither any
vegetable Curries without Maldive fish. For this
point I have given recipes to make with milk,
cream, and gravy; and to every vegetable Curry
add a spoonful of chopped ham or corned beef;
this for imitation of Maldive fish.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Still it is much
richer to vegetable Curries than Maldive fish.</p>

<p class="center smcap">In England.</p>

<li>1 lb. Coriander Seed.</li>

<li>1 Eggspoon Cumin Seed.</li>
<li>&frac12; doz. Pepper Corns.</li>
<li>Small bit of Cinnamon (1 in. square).</li>

<li>Coriander.</li>
<li>Saffron and Cumin Seed.</li>
<li>Pepper Corns. Cinnamon.</li>
<li>Dried Chillies&mdash;Rice.</li>
<li>Curry Leaves, and few other things of which cannot be procured in England.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p>N.B.&mdash;I only mention this home-made Curry Powder, if
you can procure the above said Curry Stuffs separately from
the chemists or grocers. As I heard from a gentleman in
Liverpool, &ldquo;Everything the world produces can be bought
in London&rdquo;!!!</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mode.</i>&mdash;Place a frying-pan (not an enamelled
one) on fire; soon as it gets hot put in the
coriander; when nice and gold colour take it off
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2"> </a>and put on a plate again. Set the frying-pan on
fire and add the cumin seed, pepper corns, dry
chillies. Just give a shake, and take it off and
give it two or three more shakes and put on a
plate, but don't put the saffron in the frying-pan.
Now wipe the frying-pan, and set on fire again;
when hot, put in the rice, and keep on shaking
till each grain gets goldish brown; do not let it
burn. The rice on board of ships will answer to
this better than you buying from your grocer's;
but in the scarcity of above any rice will do.</p>

<p>Now when all these are done we shall have to
grind it to a smooth powder. These cannot be
done unless you have a stone-made pounder or
Curry stone and grinder. The latter I have not
seen in England, still there is the finest strong
metal stones in England. The Curry stone and
grinder is bought for no money in up country of
Ceylon, but in Colombo, the chief city here, we
pay 50 cents, to Rs. 2&nbsp;50&nbsp;cts. each. Curry stone
and grinder will last for generations. It is better
to grind all Curry stuffs separately and keep each
in its own bottle, then you will be careful of what
you are about, and you will know how much you
are using of each stuff.</p>

<p>For any meat Curry (per lb.) add one tablespoon
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>coriander seed, a saltspoon of saffron, a pinch of
cumin seed, dash of pepper, small bit of cinnamon,
one-half tablespoon of rice powder; if preferred
hot, add a bit of cayenne. For white Curries,
only one-half teaspoon of saffron to be added.
If at hand, just cut a young capsicum in quarters
and add to the Curry. You can add a green
chillies to Meat Curries also. If the above home
made Curry Powder cannot be done, you shall
have to buy three sorts of Curry Powder. Coriander,
rice, cumin seed, and pepper (one mixture);
cayenne and saffron each separately bottled.
Other things can be got from your respective
grocers. If you buy a mixed Curry Powder or
Paste, it will taste everything too much, as following:&mdash;Heat!
hot? bitter, sour flour, spice, and too
much of yellow colour of saffron, and too much of
a nice Curry smell. The fact is, I have tasted
several Curry Powders and Paste in England, and
also in Scotland, but nothing equal to separate
Curry stuffs. If the Curry stuffs, etc., are imported
from India to Europe it will keep good for a long
time, and will have a good market, except the dry
chillies, because there is plenty of cayenne <ins title="its">in</ins>
England. Garlic ginger (green), used for any Meat
Curry, it is very healthy and helps to digest the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>Curry and rice sooner, as parties think Curries
are not easily digestible. The Curries must not
be prepared too rich, as richness takes away all
flavour, and the meat will taste like stewed Curry.
The butter you add to fry the Curry stuffs will be
quite sufficient to richen the Curry without using
fat meat.</p>

as large as champagne bottle wire, three to four

when preparing, but add two tablespoons of cream
five minutes before serving. (If I say dry, not
very dry, but second to it; add few drops of
lemon when sending to table.) This Curry must
be put on very slow fire, a hot oven will do; if so,
you must look every five minutes in case it burns.
This Curry can be eaten with rice, boiled potatoes,
or toast if wished. Some dry Curries are done in
a frying-pan within ten minutes, only the onions

Now add half-pint of good milk, or gravy, and let

add a spoonful of cream, few drops of lemon, and
salt to taste, and send to table with boiled rice,

<div class="note">
<p>N.B.&mdash;This Curry must not overdo, neither must the meat

hot, add little cayenne pepper.</p>

When the onions are nice and brown, just fry the

If it is very dry, add little more gravy to it. A
few drops of lemon will flavour it, but I recommend
to make the chicken into a &ldquo;moley,&rdquo; as No.&nbsp;29.

muslin and add to the Curry. Tamarind is always
good for any sort of brown Curry, and lemon

not taste nice if curried. If you have any

so. Then take out and scrape off all the black
stuff, and clean it as white as a white tablecloth,
and boil it tender as you boil for &ldquo;Tripe Fricassee.&rdquo;
When cool cut it in half-inch squares,
slightly pepper it. Place a stew-pan on fire, and
put in a lump of butter. When hot add the tripe,
fry it to a brownish gold colour, then take out and
put in a plate till required. Now add the Curry

turn it over and over till nice and brown. Now
add the tripe you fried, and half-pint of good
gravy, and let it simmer gently on slow fire. When
serving add a tablespoon of cream and few drops
of lemon. Some nice spices and a pinch of
cayenne pepper should be added when frying the
Curry Powders. This is a very nice Curry. By-the-by,
the gravy you boil the tripe in should be
boiled with other bones, vegetables, etc., and add

<p>This is a changeable way to have mutton chops

Take eight good chops, and flavour it the usual as
for serving itself (I mean place the chops on a flat
dish, pepper and salt it). Vinegar, a dash of
Lucca oil, and few drops of sauce, and let these
soak for a few minutes, then place a frying-pan on
fire, add a lump of butter. When melted add the
chops, and fry it in usual way of mutton chops.
When done take it off the frying-pan, keep it in a
plate. Now take a large onion and slice it, and
fry it to a gold colour in the frying-pan you fried
the chops, then add all the Curry stuffs to it as
said in the Madras Curry, No.&nbsp;4, except the
cayenne, ginger, and garlic. When all these are
nicely fried add four spoons of good stock (brown),
and now add the chops into the frying-pan. Let
it warm, then serve on a hot dish, and send to

Mashed potatoes should join this dish, and boiled
spinach fried in butter with an onion will be a nice
accompaniment, but tough part of beef wouldn't
do neither. You must not beat up the steaks with
a chopper or steak tenderer, because all the juice
will be out; scarcely any taste. When serving
add a few drops of lemon juice, and this Curry will
taste nicer if gleeced before sending to table in the
following way:&mdash;Set a stew-pan on fire, when hot
put a small bit of butter and a small onion, finely
sliced, and teaspoon of any gravy. Now use a
wooden spoon for frying the onions, and press
them in the sauce-pan. When nice and brown
colour, and the fried onions have stuck in the
sauce-pan, pour the Curry you prepared and a
spoon of cream; let it simmer a few minutes.

nice, and the meat almost like the soup meat or plain boiled
meat; but the Curried Rabbit is not a bad recipe, if properly
made, to use as an ordinary entree.</p>

<p>Take a small rabbit; skin it; and cut up in
small pieces as large as two inch square; flour it,
and fry in butter or lard, just underdone, and
brown it outside; keep it to a side. Now place
a stew-pan on fire, and add the remaining butter
or lard you fried the rabbit with; when this lard is

gold, add a pint of gravy or milk, and let it
simmer gently on slow fire; and quarter of an hour

half teaspoon of saffron powder (yellow); half-pint

of his master. When he gets into the rest-house,
the rest-house keeper knows that a gentleman is
coming. At once he will order to kill a chicken
and grill it in Scotch form? and boil two eggs;
when this is doing the kitchen mate<a name="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> will squeeze
half of a cocoanut, with little water mix some
saffron, salt green chillie, Maldive fish, etc., now

similar to above with addition of soup. Sometimes

all sides nice and gold colour, take the fowl out of
the pan. Now add all the Curry stuffs, spices,
ginger, garlic, etc., etc., and the broth that the

I am afraid it wouldn't do for large establishments
as hotels, etc., but for family houses it is a better
way. The jar to be placed in a large pan, half
full of water, and see it occasionally to prevent
drying up.</p>

<h2><a name="No_57">No.&nbsp;57.</a>&mdash;CURRY POWDER (a most
excellent).</h2>
</div>



<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 Large Old Fowls.</li>
<li>1 lb. Coriander.</li>
<li>&#8539; lb. Chillies or Cayenne.</li>
<li>6 oz. Saffron.</li>
<li>2 Large Spoons Cumin Seed.</li>
<li>1 oz. Dry Ginger.</li>
<li>2 oz. Garlic.</li>
<li>4 Large Spoons of Rice Powder, as No.&nbsp;48; or 4 Large Spoons of Dried Peas (roasted and ground).</li>
<li>&frac12; Handful Dried Bay Leaves.</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon Peppercorns.</li>
<li>2 doz. Cloves.</li>
<li>&frac14; lb. Button Onions,</li>
<li>&frac14; lb. Butter or Ghee.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Mode.</i>&mdash;Clean the fowls and cut them in small
pieces, the giblets and all. Put into a large
saucepan, and add a few quarts of water, and boil
it very tender&mdash;I mean simmer gently for two
days. The bones, meat, etc., should be mashed
up. Now take out all the bones, and keep to a
side. Take a large saucepan, put in the butter
and sliced onions, and fry it to a brown colour.
Now add all the Curry Powders, garlic chopped
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>up, bay leaves, dry ginger, cloves, pepper, all in
powders, and fry gently for a few minutes. Now
add the gravy of boiled fowls, with the meat, etc.,
and let it simmer so a few minutes. When all
these are reduced to three quarts, just dish it on
a flat dish and let it cool for a day, or till it gets
hard as a brick. Now pound this in a stone-made
mortar to a smooth powder, and bottle it, well
corked, and use for Brown Curries, a dessertspoon
to a pound, with sliced onions, milk or
gravy, and lemon juice.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>N.B.&mdash;The above recipe is a most excellent of all the
Curry Powders and Pastes, only second to none. In India
we can prepare the above with tamarind included, for acid
taste, and few other ingredients which can get fresh in
Ceylon and India, but I think not procurable in England.</p>

<h2><a name="No_58">No.&nbsp;58.</a>&mdash;TOMATO CURRY.</h2>
</div>


<p>For a pound of young or green tomato, ingredients
same as for Potato Curry, No.&nbsp;35, or for
Brown Curry same as No.&nbsp;4, Madras Curry. Treat
it same as the Cabbage Curry. But I recommend
that tomatoes should be made Brown Curry&mdash;tastes
nice. Tomato curried is better than all
the vegetables if it is properly made. Ripe
tomato not nice when curried, only for salads.</p>

<h2><a name="No_59">No.&nbsp;59.</a>&mdash;CURRIES UNDER VARIOUS
NAMES.</h2>
</div>


<p>As to my opinion, Curries can be made from
anything, if you could procure the proper Curry
Powders, etc. Almost every Curry is made one
or two ways, by only reducing, exceeding, or
mixing the various Curry stuffs. Some Curries
are hot, some dry, some juicy, some sour, and so
on. Then the cooks celebrate the names in the
menu as Delhi Curry, Agra Curry, Madras Curry,
Curry à la Punjab, Bengal Curry, Mysore Curry,
and several other names too numerous to mention
in this little work. But I myself and several
parties who have visited India will be glad to
recommend Madras Curries as best; and Ceylon
Singhalese Curry (yellow) is good, made of cocoanut
juice, Maldive fish, lemon, Curry leaves,
saffron, etc. Several cooks add too much ghee
or butter, lard, etc., but it only spoils the taste of
the Curry; and some cooks put too much spice,
and give it too much flavouring. Reasonable
ingredients couldn't spoil a Curry. A small girl
of 10 years of age will make a Curry, as Curries
are easily made in India and Ceylon.</p>
